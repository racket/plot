The contract for @(racket anchor) arguments and parameters, such as @(racket plot-legend-anchor).

The @racket['auto] anchor will place labels so they are visible on the plot
area.  This anchor type is useful for @(racket point-label) and similar
renderers where the labeled point might be at the edge of the plot area and
the user does not wish to calculate the exact anchor for the label.

The @racket['auto] anchor will choose one of the @racket['bottom-left],
@racket['bottom-right], @racket['top-left] or @racket['top-right] placements,
in that order, and will use the first one that would result in the label being
completely visible.

The @racket['auto] anchor is only valid for placement of text labels, for all
other use cases, the @racket['auto] anchor is always the same as
@racket['bottom-left].}

A contract for very flexible color arguments.
Functions that accept a @racket[color/c] almost always convert it to an RGB triplet using @racket[->color].

@section{Appearance Argument List Contracts}

@defproc[(maybe-function/c [in-contract contract?] [out-contract contract?])
         contract?
         #:value (or/c out-contract (in-contract . -> . out-contract))]{
Returns a contract that accepts either a function from @racket[in-contract] to @racket[out-contract], or a plain @racket[out-contract] value. 

@interaction[#:eval plot-eval
                    (require racket/contract)
                    (define/contract (maybe-function-of-real-consumer x)
                        ((maybe-function/c real? real?) . -> . real?)
                      (maybe-apply x 10))
                    (maybe-function-of-real-consumer 4)
                    (maybe-function-of-real-consumer (位 (x) x))]

Many @racketmodname[plot] functions, such as @racket[contours] and @racket[isosurfaces3d], optionally take lists of appearance values (such as @racket[(listof plot-color/c)]) as arguments.
A very flexible argument contract would accept @italic{functions} that produce lists of appearance values.
For example, @racket[contours] would accept any @racket[f] with contract @racket[((listof real?) . -> . (listof plot-color/c))] for its @racket[#:colors] argument.
When rendering a contour plot, @racket[contours] would apply @racket[f] to a list of the contour @italic{z} values to get the contour colors.

However, most uses do not need this flexibility.
Therefore, @racketmodname[plot]'s functions accept @italic{either} a list of appearance values @italic{or} a function from a list of appropriate values to a list of appearance values.
The @racket[maybe-function/c] function constructs contracts for such arguments.

In @racketmodname[plot] functions, if @racket[in-contract] is a @racket[listof] contract, the output list's length need not be the same as the input list's length.
If it is shorter, the appearance values will cycle; if longer, the tail will not be used.
}

@defproc[(maybe-apply [f (maybe-function/c any/c any/c)]
                      [arg any/c])
         any/c]{
If @racket[f] is a function, applies @racket[f] to @racket[args]; otherwise returns @racket[f].

This is used inside many renderer-producing @racket[plot] functions to convert @racket[maybe-function/c] values to lists of appearance values.
}

@defproc[(plot-colors/c [in-contract contract?]) contract? #:value (maybe-function/c in-contract (listof plot-color/c))]{
Returns a contract for @(racket #:colors) arguments, as in @(racket contours) and @racket[contour-intervals].
See @racket[maybe-function/c] for a discussion of the returned contract.

The following example sends a @italic{list}-valued @racket[(plot-colors/c ivl?)] to @racket[contour-intervals], which then cycles through the colors:
@interaction[#:eval plot-eval
                    (plot (contour-intervals (位 (x y) (+ x y)) 0 1 0 1
                                             #:colors '(1 2)))]
This is equivalent to sending @racket[(位 _ '(1 2))].

The next example is more sophisticated: it sends a @italic{function}-valued @racket[(plot-colors/c ivl?)] to @racket[contour-intervals].
The function constructs colors from the values of the contour intervals.
@interaction[#:eval plot-eval
                    (define (brown-interval-colors ivls)
                      (define z-size (- (ivl-max (last ivls))
                                        (ivl-min (first ivls))))
                      (for/list ([i  (in-list ivls)])
                        (match-define (ivl z-min z-max) i)
                        (define z-mid (/ (* 1/2 (+ z-min z-max)) z-size))
                        (list (* 255 z-mid) (* 128 z-mid) (* 64 z-mid))))
                    
                    (plot (contour-intervals (位 (x y) (+ x y)) 0 1 0 1
                                             #:colors brown-interval-colors))]
